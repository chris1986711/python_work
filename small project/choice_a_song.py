Baby_by_Bieber="""Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh whoa
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Said, "There's another" and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time and I was like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around and I'm like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Luda!
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was star-struck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
It skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing
'Cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
I'm gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone"""

Hotline_Bling_by_Drake="""You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city..."""

Flawless_by_Beyonce="""Your challengers are a young group from Houston
Welcome, Beyonc√©, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly and Ashley
The hip hop rappin' Girls' TYME"
I'm out that H, town coming coming down
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, Town, Town, I'm coming down, coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches
Bow down, bitches, bow bow down, bitches (crown)
Bow down, bitches, bow bow down, bitches (crown)
H Town, vicious
H, H Town, vicious
I'm so crown crown, bow down, bitches
I'm about that H, town, coming coming down
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, Town, Town, I'm coming down, coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground
We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man"
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My rock, flawless
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say I, look so good tonight
God damn, God damn
Say I, look so good tonight
God damn, God damn
Mama taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this

Fall_by_Eminem="""You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it "Walk on Water" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got him!
Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Line 'em up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Rrr
Don't fall on my fate
Look
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted 
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "He ain't spit like this on his last shit"
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up"
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition
Slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot a head (pew)
Gabby Gifford, my attack is viscous, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a f', bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sack-rilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is 
To help you put together some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole the show
Sorry if I took forever
Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
I won't
Don't fall on my fate
Line 'em up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Ha
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves 
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary 
In my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of turnt you're minus
Mine says very, yours says hardly
And what's scary is you probably can compare me to your car 
'Cause I'm just barely gettin' started
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone, then go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles
The Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat 
Piss and moan, but I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (Yeah)
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire"""
